## Asumptions
- I've not added any error handling I'm assuming the user will only enter whole numbers and no blank spaces
- I've assumed we only want to run this program once otherwise I would have made it ask for another array after printing the output
- Assuming integers are big enough for the use case 
- No validation added to the numbers negative numbers will work e.g. if you have -1 2 3 and a sum of 2 -1+3 will be found as a match
